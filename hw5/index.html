            <h2>Web 1.0 vs 2.0</h2>
            <p>While web 1.0 was much more static and information was "published"
                to be shared with the public, Web 2.0 marked a new era of websites 
                where users could create + engage with information and share it on the 
                internet with no technical knowledge. People went from creating websites 
                to creating blogs, to posting on social media platforms. In the Web 2.0 
                era, data became a valuable commodity, and corporations are doing 
                their best to get their hands on it. User interaction (clicks, views, 
                attention) and advertising have become the currency of the internet.

                  <h2>Neutral Surveillance</h2>
                  <img src="pics/files.jpeg">
                  <p>In one school of thought, surveillance is a necessary
                    collection of information for the purposes of organization 
                    and administration. When you have a large enough collection 
                    of people, information and organization is required for society 
                    to function, especially in modern information societies. Consider 
                    how the government census is used to figure out how to structure 
                    government programs, distribute aid, and just generally to create 
                    budgets. In this framing, surveillance is simply the means of 
                    gathering information.

                  <h2>Negative Surveillance</h2>
                  <img src="pics/camera.jpg">
                  <p>Negative surveillance, on the other hand, embodies the 
                    typical negative connotations people have towards surveillance, 
                    the one that imagines "big brother" looking over people's shoulders. 
                    According to Christian Fuchs, "Negative approaches see 
                    surveillance as a form of 
                    systematic information gathering that is connected to domination,
                    coercion, the threat of using violence, or the actual use of violence 
                    in order to attain certain goals and accumulate power, in many cases 
                    against the will of those who are under surveillance."

                  <h2>Big Data</h2>
                  <img src="pics/blue_particle.jpg">
                  <p>Web 2.0 has supercharged society's ability to collect data, 
                    as well as to use that data to influence people. From advertising 
                    to social media to trends to movements, the internet manages to 
                    encapsulate so much of the human experience, while also embodying 
                    its own unique, universal, virtual experience. In a capitalistic 
                    society, the surveillance potential of the internet is irresistible 
                    and full of profit potential.</p>
                  <p>That is because web 2.0 has produced 
                    an age of mass self-surveillance, where people have gotten into the 
                    habit of freely producing content and data about themselves and 
                    sharing it online, where it can reach a global audience. For corporations, 
                    it becomes but a matter of collecting all this data, and then analyzing 
                    it to influence future business decisions and increase their desirability 
                    to customers. In this manner, even neutral surveillance methods can be utilized 
                    to influence consumers, regardless of how actively they use the internet. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps it is not until the era of Web 3.0 and decentralization takes hold, will 
                    we be able to move past the surveillance capabilities of the internet, 
                    to disconnect the concept of negative surveillance from an information society.

                    shared some information over the internet (that I promise 
                    won't be stored because I haven't figured out how to
