            <h2>Why is thee internet SUCH a powerFUL medium!</h2>
            <p> 
              It is the most interactive medium of communication right
              after in-person conversation (if one can consider that a 
              form of media. Afterall, is media not simply just a form 
              of communication?) Moreso than books. More than television, then 
              pictures. More than art, than radio, than music. The 
              internet is all these things and more.

                    The internet is 2 way, mass communication. But we only 
                    have some control over the information we receive, and 
                    how we interact with it. For example, we can pause, 
                    rewind, or change movies halfway through while streaming. 
                    But we cannot change the storyline or color scheme of 
                    the movie.

                  <p> 
                    We can post whatever we like. But we can only 
                    post what a website allows us to, logistically and 
                    semantically. The data will be transmitted as 
                    electricity over wires, and we do not have a say 
                    in this. We cannot control how various people online 
                    interact with our content, how they comment, make memes, 
                    post reactions.

                    the message transformed in the transportation process, 
                    and limited by the medium? How is the interaction 
                    shaped by the user?

                    In "The Medium is the Massage" by Marshall
                    McLuhan, there are many messages given in 
                    variable formats. What 
                    kind of message do you want to see? Click 
                    a button and find out, for the power 
                    of this medium relies on you!

                    You cannot know what is in store until
                    you make a choice. But you must take 
                    action if you want to know. How will 
                    you choose to imbue meaning into the 
                    message? To what extent will you cooperate 
                    in receiving the intentions of the message?
