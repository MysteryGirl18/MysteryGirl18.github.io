                  <h2>Art As Information</h2>
                  <p>
                    Art used to be just...art. A medium of expression- a way for an artist to convey something to their audience,
                    share their beliefs, or illustrate their imagination. But whereas we used to go to a physical location to witness 
                    a piece of art, now art can be transmitted around books and online, and it can be used itself as a carrier of 
                    meaning. Memes are a great example of this.

                  <h2>Beyond First Person</h2>
                  <p>
                    "Perspective makes the eye the centre of the visible world." But cameras, satellites, and hellicopters 
                    mean we can capture sights beyond what the human eye can capture, and can see the world from perspectives 
                    beyond what any one person could see.

                  <h2>Ambiguous Meanings</h2>
                  <p>
                    Art is heavily tied to how we experience it, and the advent of cameras and the internet means we experience 
                    art in many contexts. Seeing an art piece in a museum vs. your home vs. a website vs. a book makes a difference. 
                    Art can carry different meanings from what the artist intended.

                  <h2>Manipulation and Distortion</h2>
                  <p>
                    From everything from photoshop to proganda, consider how we can distort images to promote certain ideas 
                    or twist the meaning of art.

                  <h2>Capturing Movement and Storytelling</h2>
                  <p>
                    Art used to be still and silent. But with film technology, we can tell new stories and express 
                    prior art in ways we never could before, and amplify the impact of art. Consider the difference 
                    in impact between a photo and a short film.

                  <h2>Information Overload</h2>
                  <p>
                    Art used to be something unique, each piece a single physical existence. You only had limited knowledge of 
                    things before actually experiencing something in person. Now, we can learn basically anything about a piece 
                    of art or body of work using the help of the internet. Mystery is largely a thing of the past.
